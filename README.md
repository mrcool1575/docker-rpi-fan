# Raspberry Pi variable speed cooling fan controller

Docker container that keeps the CPU temperature at desired level with PWM enabled fan based on [http://www.sensorsiot.org/variable-speed-cooling-fan-for-raspberry-pi-using-pwm-video138/](http://www.sensorsiot.org/variable-speed-cooling-fan-for-raspberry-pi-using-pwm-video138/)

## Docker-compose
```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  fan:
    container_name: fan
    restart: always
    image: pilotak/rpi-fan
    environment:
      - DESIRED_TEMP=45
      - FAN_PIN=12
      - FAN_PWM_MIN=25
      - FAN_PWM_MAX=100
      - FAN_PWM_FREQ=25
      - P_TEMP=15
      - I_TEMP=0.4
